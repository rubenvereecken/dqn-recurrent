# Honest truth
For now, this is just me copying and understanding DeepMind's code to our framework.
Because I'm such an honest guy, [here](https://sites.google.com/a/deepmind.com/dqn/)'s their code, and
[here](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602.pdf))'s their paper. Worth the read, it's got some good references in it.

# Future plans
Add some really fancy recurrent network elements to allow the agent to have 
long-term strategies in order to beat the harder Atari games. The ones where
the current screen isn't all there is to it.
